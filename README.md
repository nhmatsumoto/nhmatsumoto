# Hi there 👋 I'm Hiro (nhmatsumoto)

Software Engineer focused on building real-world products, AI-driven systems, and scalable software architecture.

I work mainly with .NET, TypeScript and modern web stacks, exploring autonomous agents and distributed systems as personal projects.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Ronaldinho Agent

**Ronaldinho Agent** is a personal R&D project focused on agent orchestration, tool execution and autonomous workflows.

The goal is to explore practical patterns for multi-agent systems, modular architectures and developer productivity.

- **Agent Orchestration**: multi-agent workflows, memory snapshots and tool pipelines  
- **Model Integration**: model-agnostic approach (OpenAI, Gemini and others)  
- **Architecture Experiments**: modular runtime, execution lanes, context persistence  
- **Developer Focus**: designed as a playground for testing agentic patterns in real scenarios
