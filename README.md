# Hi there 👋 I'm @nhmatsumoto

I am a Software Engineer and AI Researcher focused on autonomous agents and high-performance ecosystems.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Ronaldinho Agent

**Ronaldinho Agent** is a phenomenal autonomous engineering ecosystem. It's designed to be model-agnostic, self-evolving, and extremely resilient, implementing the **OpenClaw** standard for L6 autonomy.

- **Neural Core**: Multi-provider API gateway (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA).
- **Skills Engine**: Dynamic tool discovery and self-expansion.
- **Resilience**: Browser Ghost Mode (Playwright) fallback.
- **Architecture**: Execution Lanes and Context Persistence for secure, long-term reasoning.
